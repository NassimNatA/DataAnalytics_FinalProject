# Correlation between college statistical categories and NBA success
This is the final project for the Data Analytics course. Our topic is focused on college statistical categories and their correlation to NBA career success. This topic was selected to determine if there are stats of NBA players' college career that are indicators of NBA career success, and if they can be used  when predicting the success of other college athletes entering the NBA. If a correlation in our analysis is found, it can be a valuable indicator for predicitng the success of incoming players drafted for the NBA. 

## Source data and questions to be answered 
The sources for our data are below: 

https://data.world/bgp12/nbancaacomparisons - To compare player career statistics between the NBA and NCAA to give an overall view of a player's career trajectory.

https://data.world/achou/nba-draft-combine-measurements - Measurements for NBA draft combine participants from DraftExpress.com

https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016 - NBA Player Data Per Season From 1978-2016

We hope to answer the following questions: Is there any correlation between a player's college carreer and their NBA success? Is there any biometric data to support a correlatino between player stats and NBA success? Can these correlations be used as an efficient predictive model for future players being drafted to the NBA?

## Team communication protocol
Our protocol for communicating during this collaboration is to utilize a team slack channel that was created for sharing updates, questions, and updating members on this project. 

## College statistical categories to be explored 
* Number of all-star appearances
* Length in the league 
* Career length
* Win shares per 48 min play
* Number of years played in college 
* Massive injuries that will serve as outliers 
* Note: Only base players with combined metrics to limit and filter down the outlier data

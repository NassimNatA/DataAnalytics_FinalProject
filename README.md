# Correlation between NBA statistical categories and NBA success
Our topic is focused on NBA player statistics and their ability to predict performance in the 2019 season. This topic was selected to determine if there are stats of NBA players' career that are indicators of NBA career success, and if they can be used to predict future metrics. We arebuilding a model that will be able to predict future NBA player statistics. The season statistics we hope to predict are: rebounds, points and assists.

## Source data and questions to be answered 
The sources for our data are below: 

https://data.world/bgp12/nbancaacomparisons - To compare player career statistics between the NBA and NCAA to give an overall view of a player's career trajectory.

https://data.world/achou/nba-draft-combine-measurements - Measurements for NBA draft combine participants from DraftExpress.com

https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016 - NBA Player Data Per Season From 1978-2016

## Description of Our Data (NBA categories to be explored)

- Position
- Age
- Height
- Weight
- Draft number
- Draft round
- Average rebounds
- Average points
- Average assists
- Massive injuries that will serve as outliers

The sources for our data are the following:

● NBA Player Data Per Season From 1978-2016: https://data.world/jgrosz99/nba-player-data-1978-2016


We hope to answer the following questions: Is there any correlation between a player's college carreer and their NBA success? Is there any biometric data to support a correlatino between player stats and NBA success? Can these correlations be used as an efficient predictive model for future players being drafted to the NBA?

## Team communication protocol
Our protocol for communicating during this collaboration is to utilize a team slack channel that was created for sharing updates, questions, and updating members on this project. 

## College statistical categories to be explored 
* Number of all-star appearances
* Length in the league 
* Career length
* Win shares per 48 min play
* Number of years played in college 
* Massive injuries that will serve as outliers 
* Note: Only base players with combined metrics to limit and filter down the outlier data

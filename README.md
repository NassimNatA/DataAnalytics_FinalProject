# Correlation between college statistical categories and NBA success
This is the final project for the Data Analytics course. Our topic is focused on college statistical categories and their correlation to NBA career success. This topic was selected to determine if there are stats of NBA players' college career that are indicators of NBA career success, and if they can be used  when predicting the success of other college athletes entering the NBA. If a correlation in our analysis is found, it can be a valuable indicator for predicitng the success of incoming players drafted for the NBA. 

## Source data and questions to be answered 


## Team communication protocol
Our protocol for communicating during this collaboration is to utilize a team slack channel that was created for sharing updates, questions, and updating members on this project.
